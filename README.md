ECE-6133 final project
Authors: Kaiming Guan, Ethan Lyons

This part of the program implements Borah routing and generates the final MST tree.
The intermediate and final state of the tree is dumped into an output file, and can
be displayed using another MATLAB script.

Usage:
1. cd into the 'code' directory
2. type 'make'
3. type './borah [INPUT_FILE] [DUMP_FILE]'
